Queues on unrestricted priority domains have a running time of $\Theta$(nlogn) for sequences ofn queue operations. We describe a simple priority queue over the priority domain {\{}1,⋯,N{\}} in which initialization, insertion, and deletion takeO(loglogD) time, whereD is the difference between the next lowest and next highest priority elements in the queue. In the case of initialization,D=$\Theta$(N). Finding a least element, greatest element, and the neighbor in priority order of some specified element take constant time. We also consider dynamic space allocation for the data structures used. Space can be allocated in blocks of size $\Theta$(N                  1/p                ), for small integerp.},

	abstract= {This paper addresses the robust spanning tree problem with interval data, i.e. the case of classical minimum spanning tree problem when edge weights are not fixed but take their values from some intervals associated with edges. The problem consists of finding a spanning tree that minimizes so-called robust deviation, i.e. deviation from an optimal solution under the worst case realization of interval weights. As it was proven in Kouvelis and Yu (Robust Discrete Optimization and Its Applications, Kluwer Academic, Norwell, 1997), the problem is NP-hard, therefore it is of great interest to tackle it with some metaheuristic approach, namely simulated annealing, in order to calculate an approximate solution for large scale instances efficiently. We describe theoretical aspects and present the results of computational experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a metaheuristic approach for solving the robust spanning tree problem.},

	abstract	= {Publisher Summary Trees are particular types of graphs that on the surface appear to be quite specialized, so much so that they might not seem to merit in-depth investigation. Tree optimization problems arise in many applications, pose significant modeling and algorithmic challenges, are building blocks for constructing many complex models, and provide a concrete setting for illustrating many key ideas from the field of combinatorial optimization. Trees are the minimal graphs that connect any set of nodes, thereby permitting all the nodes to communicate with each other without any redundancies. As a result, if the arcs of a network have positive costs, the minimum cost subgraph connecting all the nodes is a tree that spans all of the nodes, that is, it is a spanning tree of the network. Tree optimization problems arise in a surprisingly large number of applications in such fields as computer networking, energy distribution, facility location, manufacturing, and telecommunications. Trees provide optimal solutions to many network optimization problems. Many optimization models, such as the ubiquitous traveling salesman problem, have embedded tree structure; algorithms for solving these models can often exploit the embedded tree structure.}
